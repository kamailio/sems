# Codec 2

## Introduction

Codec 2 is an open source speech codec designed for communications quality
speech between 700 and 3200 bit/s. The main application is low bandwidth
HF/VHF digital radio. It fills a gap in open source voice codecs beneath
5000 bit/s and is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

For more details how to download, install and use Codec2 have look at Codec2's

Once you install SEMS it automatically will create codec2 shared library
